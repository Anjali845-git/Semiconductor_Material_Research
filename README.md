# Materials Dataset – EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a materials dataset to understand relationships between physical features and **critical temperature (Tc)**.

## Overview
- Inspects dataset structure, datatypes, and summary statistics  
- Visualizes distributions of `critical_temp`, `Bandgap` and more
- Analyzes feature correlations with `critical_temp` using heatmaps, scatter plots and more

## Tools
Python • pandas • matplotlib • seaborn
